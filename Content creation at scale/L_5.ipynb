      " LIVE Updated Today at 10:54 AM UTC Stock market today: S&P 500 retreats from record as US futures slip ahead of key inflation data Karen Friar · Editor Updated Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 4:01 AM 2 min read In This Article: NQ=F -0.27% ES=F -0.11% ^GSPC +0.57% YM=F +0.05% ^DJI +0.28% US stocks pulled back from record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) slipped roughly 0.2%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were little changed, coming off fresh all-time highs for the indexes. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) fell 0.3%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by debate over the impact of Donald Trump's tariff plans and cabinet choices. • USD (^GSPC) Follow View Quote Details The October print of its preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning. Focus is on whether inflation has stalled, as some officials believe, and minutes from the Fed's last meeting suggested a cautious stance on interest-rate cuts. Economists expect annual \"core\" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. A print matching those expectations will likely weigh on bets for a rate cut in December. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from a roughly 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Updates on third-quarter GDP, durable goods data, and initial jobless claims are also on the economic docket. Questions about whether Trump's agenda will heat up price pressures are also in play for the Fed, some analysts believe, though policymakers aren't able to speak openly on the debate. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the US's top trading partners.

      " LIVE 1 update Today at 10:54 AM UTC Brian Sozzi About those potential Trump tariffs Shares of automakers General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) were throttled on Tuesday following Trump's tariffs threats toward Mexico, China and Canada. GM lost 9%, while Ford dropped 3% as both companies have a strong presence in Mexico. But automakers aren't the only companies that stand to be hurt by tariffs, of course. Think computers and t-shirts! Here's what HP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) CEO Fran Horowitz told me on the tariff topic. Enrique Lores \"Some of that [cost of potential tariffs] will have to go to consumers given what is the overall margin that we have in the categories. But again, we need to wait and see what the final tariffs are for us to define what the exact plan is going to be.\" Fran Horowitz \"When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,\" Horowitz said. \"It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge. In 2024 we will not be receiving more than 5% or 6% of our US receipts from China. We're taking a look at it country by country, but the agility that we've built into our supply chain is really what's going to help us manage through this.\" View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices CA Privacy Notice Recommended Stories Copyright © 2024 Yahoo.

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast’s expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property—such as the use of AI and other novel technologies—will continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",
