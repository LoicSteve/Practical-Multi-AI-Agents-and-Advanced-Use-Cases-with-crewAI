      "2. **Gather Requirements**: John Doe is also tasked here as he is essential in driving the discussion with the Business Owner to clarify project needs, ensuring no ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Create Wireframes**: Bob Smith, the Designer, takes on the wireframe creation, which is a creative task that aligns directly with his design expertise and requires 24 hours over 3 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Design UI/UX**: Bob Smith continues his involvement for 8 days to develop a cohesive design that captures the client’s vision, requiring extensive feedback loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Develop Website Structure**: Jane Doe is the ideal candidate for developing the website structure due to her technical skills as a Software Engineer, evidenced by the 4-day timeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Coding the Frontend**: Jane's skills are once again leveraged for frontend coding over 12 days, acknowledging her previous experience and anticipated complexities.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Back-end Development**: Jane continues onto backend development, utilizing her software knowledge to establish robust functionality over 10 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **User Navigation System Development**: Jane is responsible for the user navigation as it requires continuity in the coding environment and is crucial for user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **SEO and Fast Loading Time Optimization**: This task also falls to Jane, as it is technical and requires intimate knowledge of the website's architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Social Media Integration**: Jane performs this task as it demands a fast turnaround, which she can accomplish in a single day.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Quality Assurance Testing**: Both Alice Johnson and Tom Brown, the QA Engineers, split the testing responsibilities evenly to allow for thorough scrutiny of the website's features over 5 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Client Review & Feedback**: John Doe leads this review process with the Business Owner while soliciting feedback to ensure alignment with their vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Final Revisions**: Jane and Bob jointly address client requests by refining the website, maintaining a balance between technical builds and design tweaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **Deployment & Launch**: Jane's software expertise is crucial here as well, ensuring a smooth launch phase, supervised for any emergent issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **Post-Launch Support and Maintenance**: With Julie's ongoing involvement planned for the month, she will manage any immediate issues that arise after launch, ensuring smooth operation post-deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation strategically balances team workloads while capitalizing on individual strengths, which will optimize the project's success and promote a collaborative environment.\u001b[00m\n",
